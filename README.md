# Web File Browser

web_file_browser creates server to share a local directory.

1. The backend is written in `go`
2. The frontend is implented using `react` with material ui

#### To install dependencies (both frontend and backend):

`make prebuild`

#### To build frontend:

`make frontend`

#### To build the app:

`make all`

This will first build the frontend and then build a binary `wfe`

Pull requests are welcome.
